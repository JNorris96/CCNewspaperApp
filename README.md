Android Mobile Application for the Official Student Publication of Cornell College, The Cornellian

CSC 358: Open Source Development
Instructor: Dr. Leon Tabak

This app was developed by Sloane Bartleme, Noah Carpenter, Angel Fabila, Tim Haynes, Cole Horner, and Jacob Norris.

The Cornellian has been in print since the 1800s. In the recent years, the number of readers have declined. The staff of the school newspaper made a goal to increase its online presence by publishing stories in the online platform. With that said, a few members of the Open Source class are also in the process of making a mobile application for the Android platform in order to help reach the student journalists' goal.

Jacob Norris will continue to improve the design and performance of the mobile application in order to fulfill his undergraduate thesis (CSC 512: Professional Development in Computer Science). 

The team used Android Studio as their IDE for this project and used Java with XML files to build the mobile application. They committed to use the Scrum methodology and utilized Trello for their Scrum board which can be seen at the following link: https://trello.com/b/fPF6IOAg .
